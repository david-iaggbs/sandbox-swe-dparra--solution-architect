Epic: Allow guests to cancel their bookings online

Business Objective:
Guests currently must call the support line to cancel reservations, which drives up support costs
and generates negative NPS scores. We need a self-service cancellation flow so guests can cancel
online up to 24 hours before their slot starts.

Scope:
In scope:
- Cancellation page in the booking portal UI
- DELETE endpoint on the reservation service
- ReservationCancelled event published to EventBridge
- Email notification to the guest on successful cancellation

Out of scope:
- Partial cancellations (all-or-nothing only)
- Refund processing (handled by a separate payment team)
- Cancellations within 24 hours of the slot (blocked by business rule)

Affected domains: booking

Constraints:
- Must comply with GDPR: no PII in event payloads
- Response time < 200ms p99 for the cancellation endpoint
- Target delivery: Q2 2026
